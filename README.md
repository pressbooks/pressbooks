[Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.org) is an open source book publishing tool built on a WordPress multisite platform. Pressbooks outputs books in multiple formats, including PDF, EPUB, web, and a variety of XML flavours, using a theming/templating system, driven by CSS. Pressbooks is free software, released under the [GPL v3.0 or later](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/blob/production/LICENSE.md) license.

Our webbooks and EPUB/[PDF][pdf] exports are all driven by HTML + CSS. XML outputs have no styling.

## Requirements

Pressbooks works with PHP 8.1 and WordPress 6.5.0. Lower versions are not supported.

## Installing the Plugin

Pressbooks is not for use on an existing blog. Instead it should be used with a fresh, [multisite WordPress installation](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#multisite).

To install Pressbooks on your site, download the [latest release](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/releases/latest) and follow our [installation instructions](https://pressbooks.org/user-docs/installation/). 

You may want to try [Pressbooks.com](https://pressbooks.com/self-publishers/) before deciding whether or not you wish to host and maintain your own instance of Pressbooks. We can also [host and maintain an instance of Pressbooks for you](https://pressbooks.com/for-educational-institutions/).
