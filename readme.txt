== Installation ==

IMPORTANT!

 * Do not install PressBooks on an existing WordPress blog -- create a new WordPress install instead.
 * PressBooks works with PHP 5.4.x and WordPress 3.5.2. Lower versions are not supported.

*Part 1, WordPress generic:*

 1. Install WordPress using the [Famous 5-Minute Install](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress).

 2. [Create a Network](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) of WordPress sites, i.e.:

 3. Edit the wp-config.php file and add the following:

    `define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);`

 4. Login to the WordPress admin area. Navigate to Tools → Network Setup, click Install.

 5. Complete the steps printed on the screen (i.e. edit your `wp-config.php` and `.htaccess files` with the information provided.)

*Part 2, PressBooks specific:*

 1. Copy/move PressBooks plugin files to: __PATH_TO_YOUR_SITE__/wp-content/plugins/pressbooks/*.

 2. Log out, log in, navigate to: My Sites → Network Admin → Dashboard.

 3. Navigate to: Plugins → Installed Plugins.

 4. Network Enable "PressBooks."

 5. Navigate to: Themes → Installed Themes.

 6. Network Enable "Luther", "Clarke", "Donham", "PressBooks Publisher One", and any other PressBooks theme you want to use.

 7. Navigate to: Settings → Network Settings.

 8. Pick the most appropriate Registration Setting:
    + User accounts may be registered. (do not use this setting, since it will not allow users to create new sites/books)
    + Logged in users may register new sites. (if you are a publisher using PressBooks as a production tool, this is the best setting: it allows network administrators to add new users, who can then create books/sites. However, registration is not available to the public.)
    + Both sites and user accounts can be registered. (use this setting if you intend on offering a publishing-platform open to the public, such as PressBooks.com)

 9. Navigate to: My Books → __YOUR_SITE__ → Dashboard

 10. Navigate to: Appearance. Activate "PressBooks Publisher One"

 11. Navigate to: My Books → Network Admin → Sites

 12. Add a new site (this will be your first book).

 13. Navigate to: My Books → __YOUR_FIRST_BOOK__

 14. Navigate to: Book Information. Make sure to fill out Title, Author and Publication Date.

 15. Navigate to: Text → Organize. Make sure some content is selected for export.

*Part 3, PressBooks dependencies:*

 * For PDF export you need to install [Prince](http://pressbooks.com/prince) (note: this is not free software).
 * For MOBI export you need to install [KindleGen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211).
 * For EPUB validation you need to install [EpubCheck](http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/).
 * Form XML validation you need to install [xmllint](http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html).

Once installed, define the following wp-config.php variables. The defaults are:

	define( 'PB_PRINCE_COMMAND', '/usr/bin/prince' );
	define( 'PB_KINDLEGEN_COMMAND', '/opt/kindlegen/kindlegen' );
	define( 'PB_EPUBCHECK_COMMAND', '/usr/bin/java -jar /opt/epubcheck/epubcheck.jar' );
	define( 'PB_XMLLINT_COMMAND', '/usr/bin/xmllint' );
