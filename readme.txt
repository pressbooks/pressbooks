== Installation ==

IMPORTANT!

 * Do not install Pressbooks on an existing WordPress blog -- create a new WordPress install instead.
 * Pressbooks works with PHP 5.6.x and WordPress 4.3.1. Lower versions are not supported. If you wish to run Pressbooks in an environment where PHP < 5.6, you can add a line to wp-config.php as follows:
 
	$pb_minimum_php = '5.4';
	
However, we encourage you to upgrade your environment instead as [PHP 5.4 is no longer supported](http://php.net/supported-versions.php).

*Part 1, WordPress generic:*

 1. Install WordPress using the [Famous 5-Minute Install](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress).

 2. [Create a Network](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) of WordPress sites, i.e.:

 3. Edit the wp-config.php file and add the following:

    `define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);`

 4. Login to the WordPress admin area. Navigate to Tools → Network Setup, click Install.

 5. Complete the steps printed on the screen (i.e. edit your `wp-config.php` and `.htaccess files` with the information
    provided.)

*Part 2, Pressbooks specific:*

 1. Copy/move Pressbooks plugin files to: __PATH_TO_YOUR_SITE__/wp-content/plugins/pressbooks/*.

 2. Log out, log in, navigate to: My Sites → Network Admin → Dashboard.

 3. Navigate to: Plugins → Installed Plugins.

 4. Network Enable "Pressbooks."

 5. Navigate to: Themes → Installed Themes.

 6. Network Enable "Luther", "Clarke", "Donham", "Fitzgerald", "Austen", "Pressbooks Publisher One", and any other
    Pressbooks theme you want to use.

 7. Navigate to: Settings → Network Settings.

 8. Pick the most appropriate Registration Setting:
    + User accounts may be registered. (do not use this setting, since it will not allow users to create new books)
    + Logged in users may register new sites. (if you are a publisher using Pressbooks as a production tool, this is the
      best setting: it allows network administrators to add new users, who can then create books/sites. However,
      registration is not available to the public.)
    + Both sites and user accounts can be registered. (use this setting if you intend on offering a publishing-platform
      open to the public, such as Pressbooks.com)

 9. Navigate to: My Books → __YOUR_SITE__ → Dashboard

 10. Navigate to: Appearance. Activate "Pressbooks Publisher One"

 11. Navigate to: My Books → Network Admin → Sites

 12. Add a new site (this will be your first book).

 13. Navigate to: My Books → __YOUR_FIRST_BOOK__

 14. Navigate to: Book Information. Make sure to fill out Title, Author and Publication Date.

 15. Navigate to: Text → Organize. Make sure some content is selected for export.

*Part 3, Pressbooks dependencies:*

 * For PDF export install [Prince](http://pressbooks.com/prince) (note: this is not free software) - Version 10r5
 * For PDF export via mPDF ensure that the following folders have write access and/or they are owned by the appropriate user.See http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions for more details on adjusting file permissions.
   + wp-content/plugins/pressbooks/symbionts/mpdf/ttfontdata
   + wp-content/plugins/pressbooks/symbionts/mpdf/tmp
   + wp-content/plugins/pressbooks/symbionts/mpdf/graph_cache
 * For MOBI export install [KindleGen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211) - Version 2.9
 * For EPUB validation install [EpubCheck](https://github.com/idpf/epubcheck) - Version 4.0
 * For XML validation install [xmllint](http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html) - Version 20800
 * It is recommended that you install [sassphp](https://github.com/sensational/sassphp) for SASS compilation; however, Pressbooks includes a bundled compiler, [scssphp](https://github.com/leafo/scssphp/), and will fall back to this if sassphp is absent.
 * Certain Linux installations do not ship with the php5-xsl library enabled by default.  If you attempt to export an ePub and get a either a white screen with minimal text, or a "Fatal error: Class 'XSLTProcessor' not found" error, you may need to run a command like "apt-get install php5-xsl" 

Unlisted versions are not supported. Upgrade/downgrade accordingly.

	define( 'PB_PRINCE_COMMAND', '/usr/bin/prince' );
