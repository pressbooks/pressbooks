# Disable Comments for WordPress (Must-Use version)

This is the [must-use](http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins) version of the [Disable Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/) WordPress plugin.

Copy the contents of this directory into your `mu-plugins` directory in order to disable comments on the entire site/network, without any configuration. You should delete all existing comments from the WordPress database before activating this plugin.

If you want to be able to configure the plugin's behaviour, then use the [normal version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/).
