[Pressbooks](http://pressbooks.com) is a book content management system which exports in multiple formats: ebooks, webbooks, print-ready [PDF][], and various XML flavours. [Pressbooks](http://pressbooks.com) is built on top of [WordPress Multisite](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Multisite), and makes significant changes to:
  * admin interface (customized for books and other structured documents, such as magazines, journals, reports, etc.);
  * web presentation layer (again, customized for books and structured documents); and
  * export routines.

Pressbooks is free software, released under the GPL v.2.0 license.

Our web/ebook and [PDF][] exports are all driven by HTML+CSS. XML outputs have no styling.
