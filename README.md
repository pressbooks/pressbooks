[Pressbooks](http://pressbooks.org) is a book content management system which
produces multiple formats: ebooks, webbooks, print-ready [PDF][pdf], and various
XML flavours. [Pressbooks](http://pressbooks.org) is built on top of
[WordPress Multisite](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Multisite), and makes
significant changes to:

* admin interface (customized for books and other structured documents, such as
  magazines, journals, reports, etc.);
* web presentation layer (again, customized for books and structured documents);
  and
* export routines.

Pressbooks is free software, released under the
[GPL v3.0 or later](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/blob/master/LICENSE.md) license.

Our web/ebook and [PDF][pdf] exports are all driven by HTML + CSS. XML outputs have
no styling.

## Important!

* Do **_NOT_** use Pressbooks with an existing WordPress site.
* Please use with a **_FRESH_** install of
  [WP **_MULTISITE_**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Multisite).
