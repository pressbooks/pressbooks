# Unit Testing

The Pressbooks unit testing framework was built (then slightly tweaked) using [WP-CLI][1]. The tests run automatically on commit via [Travis-CI][2], with more in-depth reporting via [Codecov][3].

To run the tests locally, do:

`bash
cd /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/pressbook
bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test DBUSER DBPASS localhost latest
phpunit`

*   Replace `/path/to` with your path.
*   `wordpress_test` is the name of a new test database (**all data will be deleted!**)
*   `DBUSER` is your MySQL user name
*   `DBPASS` is your MySQL user password
*   `localhost` is your MySQL host
*   `latest` is the WordPress version; could also be `4.5`, `4.6` etc.
*   [PHPUnit is installed...][4].

The bash script installs a copy of WordPress and the WordPress unit testing tools in`/tmp`. It then creates a new tests database to be used while running tests. The bash script can be run multiple times without errors, but it will *not* overwrite previously existing files.

Tests are in `/tests/*.*`

Tests cover the code in `/includes/*.*`
